# ConvintoBot
This Bot sends notifications to your Telegram Channel when a new YouTube video is uploaded (or made public). 

With the last update it also include optional Twitch notifications for Live Streaming and the awesome **Subscribers Group Manager** function! 

###### This bot is really old, and its code it's absolutely shit. I started writing it when I first met OOP. It needs a complete rewrite, but I don't have enough time. Btw I'm adding instagram support. DM me (www.stranck.ovh) for more info about its functionalities
